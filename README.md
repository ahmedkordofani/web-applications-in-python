# Module 4: Web Applications

In Module 4 of the Makers course, I accomplished several key objectives that enhanced my understanding and skills in web application development, preparing me for a successful career as a software engineer:

1. **Understanding of HTTP:** I gained a high-level understanding of how HTTP requests and responses work. This foundational knowledge is essential for web application development and communication between clients and servers.

2. **Integration Testing for Web Applications:** I learned to write integration tests for web applications. This skill is crucial for ensuring the functionality and reliability of web applications.

3. **Implementation of Web Routes:** I successfully implemented web routes using a lightweight web framework. This achievement allows me to create the structure and functionality of web applications effectively.

4. **Debugging Web Applications:** I acquired a structured debugging process for web applications, enabling me to identify and resolve issues in web applications efficiently.

The accomplishments in Module 4 have provided me with valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in web application development, including understanding HTTP, creating web routes, and effectively debugging and securing web applications. These skills make me well-prepared to contribute to web development projects and create dynamic, interactive, and reliable web applications.
